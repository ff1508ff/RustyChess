# RustyChess

## Motivation

This project kicked off during my exchange program in Ireland, organized by my school. During the first two weeks, I didn't have any assigned projects, so I started working on my own. A friend suggested we build a chess bot. He already had a Python chess engine, but we couldn't agree on what kind of bot to make. He wanted something fancy like a neural network, and I just wanted to mess around with algorithms. So, in the end, I decided to create my own chess engine from scratch using Rust.

I also threw in a MySQL database because I knew we'd eventually be working with APIs and databases, so I figured, why not get some practice while I'm at it?

I didn't finish the project before the official assignment came in, but I still want to see it through.

## Updates

I try to document my journey here every time I work on the project (this is like a blog). This should motivate me and it will probably be interesting seeing how I felt or how I progressed.

**Motivation:** 9/10 \
**What I did:** I uploaded the project to a GitHub repo and wrote the motivation and Decisions chapter. \
**Notes:** I'm at "[The Clockwork Door](https://www.clockworkdoor.ie/)", which is a cool spot in Dublin. I'm excited to keep tinkering with this, because it's challenging and just plain fun. Plus, I'm learning a few fundamentals along the way. \

## Decisions

I had a course in school about "distributed systems", which was really hard, because it was a group project and as always with such projects I did way to much work in comparison to my teammates. But I learned something really important and that are design decisions. I never actively thought about them. I just worked on things and went with the first idea I had, which worked in 99% of cases. But on this project I actively thought about solutions, which are surprisingly many. From how to save the board state to how to communicate moves.
